# Machine Learning Approaches for Developing Potential Surfaces: Applications to $OH^-(H_2O)_n$ ($n=1-3$) Complexes

## Overview
This repository includes the codes and results for the manuscript:
***Machine Learning Approaches for Developing Potential Surfaces: Applications to $OH^-(H_2O)_n$ ($n=1-3$) Complexes*** [link](xxxxx)


Due to the limited space on GitHub, our Zenodo repository contains all the training and test data (structures and labels)

## Content list
 
* [mobml_reference_data](mobml_reference_data): The reference structures for each system is zipped under each zip file. The predicted energies for the test systems are also within the zip files. The reference electronic structure results are under [csvs](reference_data/csvs) folder and labeled with the corresponding systems. 

* [dmc_data](dmc_data): TODO: Greta please put your DMC data under this folder and write a description. I leave the files as what it is on google drive and not sure if they are useful. if not, please delete them.

* [dmc_model](dmc_model): TODO: Greta please put your DMC model under this folder and write a description. 

* [plot.ipynb](plot.ipynb): Plot the results and make the figures in the manuscript. 

* [lc_data.h5](lc_data.h5): Save the learning curve accuracy that could be retrived by the [plot.ipynb](plot.ipynb).
